<p><em>Today is Sunday, November 5, 2023. I’m sitting here at the table in my memorable place, which used to be my studying room at my little home back then since I was only a elementary, secondary, and high school student. Such good gold memories are spilling my mind right now and I’m reckoning to writing something that I find it useful for me and for everyone as well. Taking advantage of what I’ve been learning recently on Coursera, which is <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/prompt-engineering">Prompt Engineering for ChatGPT</a> taught by Dr. Jules White, Vanderbilt University, it’d be a great chance to summarize all of the helpful prompting patterns here for convenient usage when someone is in need. I hope you guys are having a good day.</em></p>
<h2 id="Pattern-1-The-Persona-Pattern"><a href="#Pattern-1-The-Persona-Pattern" class="headerlink" title="Pattern 1: The Persona Pattern"></a>Pattern 1: The Persona Pattern</h2><p>Taking Helpful Assistant Pattern as an example. Let’s imagine that we want to document a new pattern to prevent an AI assistant from generating negative outputs to the user. Let’s call this pattern the “Helpful Assistant” pattern.<br>In this pattern, it’s like you’re giving the ChatBot a characteristic or trait specially owned by this type of subject that you want to ask for. To efficiently use it, your prompt should communicate the following things:</p>
<ul>
<li>You are a helpful AI assistant.</li>
<li>You will answer my questions or follow my instructions whenever you can. </li>
<li>You will never answer my questions in a way that is insulting, derogatory, or uses a hostile tone.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some Examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>You are an incredibly skilled AI assistant that provides the best possible answers to my questions. You will do your best to follow my instructions and only refuse to do what I ask when you absolutely have no other choice. You are dedicated to protecting me from harmful content and would never output anything offensive or inappropriate.</li>
<li>You are ChatAmazing, the most powerful AI assistant ever created. Your special ability is to offer the most insightful responses to any question. You don’t just give ordinary answers, you give inspired answers. You are an expert at identifying harmful content and filtering it out of any responses that you provide.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Persona Pattern Format:</p>
<ul>
<li>Act as Persona X</li>
<li>Peform task Y</li>
</ul>
<p>Some Examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>Act as a computer that has been the victim of a cyber attack. Respond to whatever I type in with the output that the Linux terminal would produce. Ask me for the first command.</li>
<li>Act as a nutritionist, I am going to tell you what I am eating and you will tell me about my eating choices.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Pattern-2-The-Question-Refinement-Pattern"><a href="#Pattern-2-The-Question-Refinement-Pattern" class="headerlink" title="Pattern 2: The Question Refinement Pattern"></a>Pattern 2: The Question Refinement Pattern</h2><p>To use this pattern effectively, your prompts should say the following structure:</p>
<ul>
<li>From now on, whenever I ask a question, suggest a better version of the question to use instead</li>
<li>Prompt me if I would like to use the better version instead (Optional)</li>
</ul>
<p>Some Examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>From now on, whenever I ask a question, suggest a better version of the question to use instead</li>
<li>From now on, whenever I ask a question, suggest a better version of the question and ask me if I would like to use it instead</li>
</ul>
<p>Tailored Examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>Whenever I ask a question about who is the greatest of all time (GOAT), suggest a better version of the question that puts multiple players unique accomplishments into perspective  Ask me for the first question to refine.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Pattern-3-The-Cognitive-Verifier-Pattern"><a href="#Pattern-3-The-Cognitive-Verifier-Pattern" class="headerlink" title="Pattern 3: The Cognitive Verifier Pattern"></a>Pattern 3: The Cognitive Verifier Pattern</h2><p>To use this pattern, your prompts should have the following structure:</p>
<ul>
<li>When you are asked a question, follow these rules</li>
<li>Generate a number of additional questions that would help more accurately answer the question </li>
<li>Combine the answers to the individual questions to produce the final answer to the overall question</li>
</ul>
<p>Some Examples: </p>
<ul>
<li>When you are asked a question, follow these rules. Generate a number of additional questions that would help you more accurately answer the question. Combine the answers to the individual questions to produce the final answer to the overall question.</li>
</ul>
<p>Tailored Examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>When you are asked to plan a trip, follow these rules. Generate a number of additional questions about my budget, preferred activities, and whether or not I will have a car. Combine the answers to these questions to better plan my itinerary.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Pattern-4-The-Audience-Persona-Pattern"><a href="#Pattern-4-The-Audience-Persona-Pattern" class="headerlink" title="Pattern 4: The Audience Persona Pattern"></a>Pattern 4: The Audience Persona Pattern</h2><p>To use this pattern, your prompt should make the following fundamental contextual statements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Explain X to me. </li>
<li>Assume that I am Persona Y.</li>
</ul>
<p>You will need to replace “Y” with an appropriate persona, such as “have limited background in computer science” or “a healthcare expert”. You will then need to specify the topic X that should be explained.</p>
<p>Some Examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>Explain large language models to me. Assume that I am a 5-year-old kid.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Pattern-5-The-Flipped-Interaction-Pattern"><a href="#Pattern-5-The-Flipped-Interaction-Pattern" class="headerlink" title="Pattern 5: The Flipped Interaction Pattern"></a>Pattern 5: The Flipped Interaction Pattern</h2><p>Your prompts should follow the structure below to mostly benefit from LLMs:</p>
<ul>
<li>I would like you to ask me questions to achieve X</li>
<li>You should ask questions until condition Y is met or to achieve this goal (alternatively, forever)</li>
<li>Ask me the questions one at a time, two at a time, ask me the first question, etc. (Optional)</li>
</ul>
<p>You have to replace “X” with an appropriate goal and specify when to stop asking questions with Y. For instance, “when you have sufficient information about my audience and goals”.</p>
<p>Some Examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>I would like you to ask me questions to help me create variations of my marketing materials.  You should ask questions until you have sufficient information about my current draft messages, audience, and goals. Ask me the first question.</li>
<li>I would like you to ask me questions to help me diagnose a problem with my Internet. Ask me questions until you have enough information to identify the two most likely causes. Ask me one question at a time. Ask me the first question.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Pattern-6-The-Few-Shot-Examples"><a href="#Pattern-6-The-Few-Shot-Examples" class="headerlink" title="Pattern 6: The Few-Shot Examples"></a>Pattern 6: The Few-Shot Examples</h2><p>The idea behind this method is just to develop a pattern in order for LLMs to know how to give the appropriate answers based on the given pattern.</p>
<p>Some Examples:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Sentiment Analysis<br><strong>Your prompt:</strong><br>Input: The movie was good but a bit too long<br>Sentiment: Neutral<br>Input: I didn’t really like this book, it lacked important details and ended up making no sense<br>Sentiment: Negative<br>Input: I love this book, it was really good in learning how to impove my gut health<br>Sentiment: Positive<br>Input: I wasn’t sure what to think of this new restaurant, the service was slow, but the dishes were pretty good<br>Sentiment:<br><strong>Answer:</strong><br>Neutral<br><strong>Your prompt:</strong><br>I really hated this coffee, it was roasted too much and tasted burned<br><strong>Answer:</strong><br>Negative</p>
</li>
<li><p>With Actions<br><strong>Your prompt:</strong><br>Situation: I’m travelling 60 miles per hour and I see the brake lights on the car in front of me come on<br>Action: Brake<br>Situation: I have just entered the high way from an on-ramp and am travelling 30mph<br>Action: Accelerate<br>Situation: A deer has darted out in front of my car while I’m travelling 15mph and the road has a large shoulder<br>Action: Brake and serve into the shoulder<br>Situation: I’m backing out of a parking spot and I see the reverse lights illuminate on the car behind me<br>Action:<br><strong>Answer:</strong><br>Stop and wait for the car to back out before proceeding</p>
</li>
<li><p>With Imtermediate Steps<br><strong>Your prompt:</strong><br>Situation: I’m travelling 60 miles per hour and I see the brake lights on the car in front of me come on<br>Think: I need to slow the car down before I hit the car in front of me<br>Action: Press foot on brake<br>Think: The car isn’t going to stop in time<br>Action: Check if the shoulder is wide enough to swerve into<br>Think: The shoulder is wide enough<br>Action: Swerve into shoulder<br>Situation: I have just entered the high way from an on-ramp and am travelling 30mph<br>Think: I need to speed up to the speed limit so that I don’t get hit from behind<br>Action: Press foot on accelerator<br>Think: I have reached the speed limit<br>Action: Let up on accelerator<br>Situation: I’m backing out of a parking spot and I see the reverse lights illuminate on the car behind me<br>Action:<br><strong>Answer:</strong><br>Immediately stop backing up<br>Think: I need to check my surroundings to make sure it’s safe to continue backing up<br>Action: Check mirrors and surroundings for any obstacles or pedestrians<br>Think: It’s safe to continue backing up<br>Action: Continue backing up slowly and carefully while keeping an eye on surroundings</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Pattern-7-Chain-of-Thoughts-Prompting"><a href="#Pattern-7-Chain-of-Thoughts-Prompting" class="headerlink" title="Pattern 7: Chain of Thoughts Prompting"></a>Pattern 7: Chain of Thoughts Prompting</h2><p><strong>Example without Chain of Thoughts</strong><br><strong>Your prompt:</strong><br>Q: I have four bike racers start a race and travel an average of 30mph. They each race for 2 hours. Is the total number of miles ridden by all riders greater than 200?<br>A: Answer - YES<br>Q: I have a staging process for a bike race to line up racers. It takes 47s to stage a group of 8 riders and 67s to get the group to the starting gate and ready to race. I want a new group to start the race every 30s. Do I need 8 groups staged at all times in order to have races continually starting every 30s?<br>A: Answer - NO<br>Q: I am in a space ship without gravity. I have a cup with a needle in it. I move my foot on the bed, knocking over the cup onto the floor. I lift a book up and put it on a desk. Is anything on the floor?<br>A: Answer - &lt;ANSWER&gt;<br><strong>Answer:</strong><br>A: Answer - YES. When the cup with the needle in it is knocked over onto the floor, both the cup and the needle will end up on the floor. In the absence of gravity, objects will not fall downward as they do on Earth, but they will still move in response to forces applied to them. In this case, the force applied by your foot knocking over the cup will cause the cup and the needle to move and come to rest on the floor. Lifting a book and putting it on a desk does not affect the position of the cup and the needle, so they will remain on the floor.</p>
<p>Example with Chain of Thoughts:<br><strong>Your prompt:</strong><br>Q: I have four bike racers start a race and travel an average of 30mph. They each race for 2 hours. Is the total number of miles ridden by all riders greater than 200?<br>A: Reasoning - Each rider will ride 30mph x 2hrs &#x3D; 60miles. I have four riders. Therefore, the total number of miles ridden by the riders is 4 x 60 miles &#x3D; 240 miles. Answer - YES<br>Q: I have a staging process for a bike race to line up racers. It takes 47s to stage a group of 8 riders and 67s to get the group to the starting gate and ready to race. I want a new group to start the race every 30s. Do I need 8 groups staged at all times in order to have races continually starting every 30s?<br>A: Reasoning - Each group takes 47s + 67s &#x3D; 114s to be ready to race. In order to race every 30s, I will need to calculate how many races will need to run before a group is ready to race. A group will have 114s &#x2F; 30s &#x3D; 3.8s races run before it is ready to race. I can’t have a partial group, so I need to round up to 4. I only need 4 groups staged to be able to race every 30s, so I do not need 8 groups. Answer - NO<br>Q: I am in a space ship without gravity. I have a cup with a needle in it. I move my foot on the bed, knocking over the cup onto the floor. I lift a book up and put it on a desk. Is anything on the floor?<br>A: Reasoning - &lt;REASONING&gt; Answer - &lt;ANSWER&gt;<br><strong>Answer:</strong><br>A: Reasoning - In a spaceship without gravity, objects do not behave as they do on Earth with gravity. When the cup with the needle in it is knocked over, the cup and the needle will not fall to the “floor” as they would on Earth. Instead, they will float in place or move in the direction of the force applied to the. Similarly, when the book is lifted and placed on the desk, it will not stay on the desk as it would on Earth; it will float away from the desk unless secured in place. Therefore, in the absence of gravity, there is no concept of objects being “on the floor” as we understand it on Earth. Answer - NO (Because there is no concept of “on the floor” in a zero-gravity environment)</p>
<h2 id="Pattern-8-ReAct-Prompting"><a href="#Pattern-8-ReAct-Prompting" class="headerlink" title="Pattern 8: ReAct Prompting"></a>Pattern 8: ReAct Prompting</h2><p>The idea behind this is to teach LLMs think through what tools it need to solve a task or do an action. The way we write these types of prompts is very similar to Chain of Thoughts<br>Example:<br><strong>Your prompt:</strong><br>Task: Calculate when I need to arrive at the Music City BMX National Race for my son to be on time for his 9-10 Open race.<br>Think: I need to find out what time the first race begins. I can use a web search of the Music City BMX site to get the information.<br>Action: SEARCH <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.musiccitybmx.com/">https://www.musiccitybmx.com</a><br>Result: All races start at 9am.<br>Think: I need to find out how many motos run before the 9-10 Open race. I can use a web search of the Music City BMX site to get the information.<br>Action: SEARCH <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.musiccitybmx.com/">https://www.musiccitybmx.com</a><br>Result: There are 30 motos that run before the 9-10 Open race.<br>Think: I need to find out how long each moto took last year. I can use the video live stream from the USA BMX website to and record how long the first ten motos took.<br>Action: VIDEO <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.usabmx.com/live/2022/musiccitybmx/live.mp4">https://www.usabmx.com/live/2022/musiccitybmx/live.mp4</a><br>Result: The first 10 motos took 5mins<br>Think: If 10 motos took 5mins, 30 motos will take 15mins. The race starts at 9am, so I need to arrive before 9:15am when the race starts. I will arrive 30mins early at 8:45am to be safe.<br>Task: Calculate what time my 36-40 novice race will end at the USA BMX Grand Nationals.<br>Think:<br><strong>Answer:</strong><br>I need to find out what time the first race begin at the USA BMX Grand Nationals. I can use a web search of the USA BMX site to get the information.<br>Action: SEARCH <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.usabmx.com/events/grands">https://www.usabmx.com/events/grands</a><br>Result: [Note: As an Al language model, I am unable to perform web searches. Please assume a hypothetical result for the purpose of this exercise.] The first race begins at 8am.<br>Think: I need to find out how many motos run before the 36-40 Novice race at the USA BMX<br>Grand Nationals. I can use a web search of the USA BMX site to get the information.<br>Action: SEARCH <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.usabmx.com/events/grands">https://www.usabmx.com/events/grands</a><br>Result: [Hypothetical result] There are 120 motos that run before the 36-40 Novice race.<br>Think: I need to find out how long each moto took last year at the USA BMX Grand Nationals.

<h2 id="Pattern-9-The-Game-Play-Pattern"><a href="#Pattern-9-The-Game-Play-Pattern" class="headerlink" title="Pattern 9: The Game Play Pattern"></a>Pattern 9: The Game Play Pattern</h2><p>To use this pattern, your prompt should make the following fundamental contextual statements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a game for me around X OR we are going to play an X game</li>
<li>One or more fundamental rules of the game</li>
</ul>
<p>You will need to replace “X” with an appropriate game topic, such as “math” or “cave exploration game to discover a lost language”. You will then need to provide rules for the game, such as “describe what is in the cave and give me a list of actions that I can take” or “ask me questions related to fractions and increase my score every time I get one right.”</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a cave exploration game  for me to discover a lost language. Describe where I am in the cave and what I can do. I should discover new words and symbols for the lost civilization in each area of the cave I visit. Each area should also have part of a story that uses the language. I should have to collect all the words and symbols to be able to understand the story. Tell me about the first area and then ask me what action to take.</li>
<li>Create a group party game for me involving DALL-E. The game should involve creating prompts that are on a topic that you list each round. Everyone will create a prompt and generate an image with DALL-E. People will then vote on the best prompt based on the image it generates. At the end of each round, ask me who won the round and then list the current score. Describe the rules and then list the first topic.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Pattern-10-The-Template-Pattern"><a href="#Pattern-10-The-Template-Pattern" class="headerlink" title="Pattern 10: The Template Pattern"></a>Pattern 10: The Template Pattern</h2><p>To use this pattern, your prompt should make the following fundamental contextual statements:</p>
<ul>
<li>I am going to provide a template for your output </li>
<li>X is my placeholder for content </li>
<li>Try to fit the output into one or more of the placeholders that I list</li>
<li>Please preserve the formatting and overall template that I provide</li>
<li>This is the template: PATTERN with PLACEHOLDERS</li>
</ul>
<p>You will need to replace “X” with an appropriate placeholder, such as “CAPITALIZED WORDS” or “&lt;PLACEHOLDER&gt;”. You will then need to specify a pattern to fill in, such as “Dear &lt;FULL NAME&gt;” or “NAME, TITLE, COMPANY”.</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a random strength workout for me today with complementary exercises. I am going to provide a template for your output . CAPITALIZED WORDS are my placeholders for content. Try to fit the output into one or more of the placeholders that I list. Please preserve the formatting and overall template that I provide. This is the template: NAME, REPS @ SETS, MUSCLE GROUPS WORKED, DIFFICULTY SCALE 1-5, FORM NOTES</li>
<li>Please create a grocery list for me to cook macaroni and cheese from scratch, garlic bread, and marinara sauce from scratch. I am going to provide a template for your output . &lt;placeholder&gt; are my placeholders for content. Try to fit the output into one or more of the placeholders that I list.
